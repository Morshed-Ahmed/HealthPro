A Hospital Management System

Create a hospital management website. Which will be really helpful for doctors. They can create accounts, log in, and log out when they're done. Once they're logged in, they can enter details about their patients. These details will show up on their profile pages, so they can see them easily. And all the records added by the doctor also are on the main page of the website. They can even filter doctors by their expertise.
